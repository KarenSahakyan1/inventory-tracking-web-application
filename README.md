# Requirements:

   Basic CRUD Functionality
   ------------------------
   As the following was in the assignment requirements: Donâ€™t assume any technologies exist in the reviewer's environment. 
   I handled the data without using a database. All the information is save in the Data folder under Product.json file (in json format) 
   In the application top navigation bar which is also functioning on mobile version, I have the following menu icons:
   - Product List
   - Product
   - Add a product
   - Admin product (which is used for editing and deleting purposes)

  First option: "Push a button to export product to CSV"
  ------------------------------------------------------
   In the product list menu, I created the export CSV and download CSV buttons. 

   The export CSV button can be used to filter the products and convert them into CSV format. At present, it converts by Default into the Data folder
   in the    product.json file where all the data is handled and is saved in the Data folder product.csv file.

   Download CSV button downloads the product.csv file
